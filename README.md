This project is helping me build a webapp without any starter code so that I know how to go about creating a full webpage with stylesheet and script. Along with being tested on understanding of creating a webapp I am adding something valuable to my job seeking tools. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

 * Create a html, css, and js file
 * Create a repository on github and use gitbash terminal to locally keep code files updated online
 * Deploy all built code to gitpages so to have a website
 * Add information about yourself and present it on a traditional web browser or reponsive to devices with alt resolutions (media query) 
 * Structure code schemantics in a way so you or anyone else can continue working on this project in the future
